# Personal RNG Consciousness Experiment App

A research-grade desktop application that replicates PEAR laboratory and Global Consciousness Project methodology for personal consciousness-RNG interaction experiments.

## Scientific Background

This application is based on decades of research conducted at the Princeton Engineering Anomalies Research (PEAR) laboratory and continues work pioneered by the Global Consciousness Project. The fundamental hypothesis being tested is whether human consciousness can influence the output of random number generators through focused intention.

### Core Research Methodology

- **Random Number Generation**: Uses macOS native random number generation
- **Data Collection**: 200-bit trials per second for statistical significance
- **Statistical Analysis**: Cumulative deviation tracking, variance analysis, z-score calculations
- **Experimental Modes**:
  - Intention-based sessions with real-time feedback
  - Continuous 24/7 monitoring with manual timeframe annotation

### Scientific Rigor

- Local data storage ensures data integrity and privacy
- Comprehensive statistical validation
- Reproducible experimental protocols
- Open methodology for peer review

## Features

### Mode 1: Intention-Based Sessions

- Set specific intention or goal
- Run timed experimental sessions
- Real-time cumulative deviation visualization
- Statistical significance tracking

### Mode 2: Continuous Monitoring

- 24/7 background RNG data collection
- Manual entry of significant life events or intention periods
- Long-term pattern analysis
- Historical data correlation

### Data Analysis

- Real-time statistical calculations
- Cumulative deviation graphs
- Z-score significance testing
- Variance analysis
- Export capabilities for further analysis

## Technical Architecture

- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript for scientific data visualization
- **Backend**: Electron for native desktop functionality
- **Database**: SQLite for local data persistence
- **Charts**: Chart.js for real-time data visualization
- **Statistics**: Scientific-grade statistical libraries

## Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Development mode
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Create distribution package
npm run dist
```

## Usage

1. **Setup**: Configure your experimental parameters
2. **Calibration**: Run baseline measurements without intention
3. **Experiment**: Conduct intention-based or continuous monitoring sessions
4. **Analysis**: Review statistical results and significance levels

## Data Privacy

All data is stored locally on your device. No data is transmitted to external servers, ensuring complete privacy and data integrity for your research.
